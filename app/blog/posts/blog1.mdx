- Bread: FREE
- Bread: Individual portion per person
- Bread temp: Warm
- Butter: Not house

## Bread 
Not expected but comes with a free individual bread and butter for each person. 

The bread is just a standard bread roll but warm and a butter that comes in a packet cup. Are they called packet cups? There are no complaints. It’s not insane. It’s not bad that you should completely dismiss it. There are fancy italian places that don’t give bread and salad and this place isn't upscale.

The free bread, butter, and salad in my opinion is generous as the salad even has cherry tomatoes. 

## Restaurant

This place is Japanese Italian fusion.

I've only been to the Cerritos location, so I can only talk about my bread and dining experience there.
