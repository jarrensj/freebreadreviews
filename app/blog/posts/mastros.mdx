## Mastro's Steakhouse in Coasta Mesa

PAID BREAD 

- Bread: Not free ($5 for bread service)
- Bread temp: warm or slightly warm, varies 
- Refills: Free from my experience
- Type of bread: Assorted
- Butter: Square

Their bread service is $5. It’s not free but I do think it’s worth. From my experience, bread refills have been free. 

The bread basket is an assortment of bread. There is a pretzel one, a lighter bread one, a darker bread one, and a crispy cheese one. The bread comes warm. My favorite is the darker bread one. 

I like their bread and alway opt / persuade my table to get the service even though a lot of people shy away from bread / carbs. I love bread. I love carbs. 

I like the darker bread that has a berry in it? But if you read or ask most people, their favorites are the crispy cheese bread or the pretzel bread. I think pretzel bread is commonly the first preference by many. That seems to be the common consensus. I’m okay with that as there is then less competition for the bread that I covet. I personally don’t like that one as much but I have more of a preference always for sweet than a preference for salt.


### Dress code

They have one but I’ve also been and came fresh out of the gym with my plain black gym pants and was fine. I’ve worn a hat and was fine but I had other people wore a hat when I didn’t wear a hat and they weren’t fine. 

This is my experience with the South Coast Mastro’s. I have not been to any other one yet but I have been to this location a few times and I do like coming here.
