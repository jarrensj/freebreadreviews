## La Tavolata

- Bread: Free
- Bread: Plate with an allocation for the table
- Bread temp: Fresh (hot)
- Bread refills: Yes

I think their free bread is good. My friend and I got 3 - 4 orders of their free bread because it was that good. The bread was plated as an allocation for the table with each round being four pieces of bread, two for each of us.

This place takes reservations and is only open 5 - 9 pm on some days. This place takes a bit of a while wait if you are just walking in without a reservation. The space is tight. 

Their free bread dish is amazing. It might be the one of the best free bread. I highly recommend experiencing their free bread. I can't believe we got multiple rounds but no pictures. I plan to make a reservation and come again.

I recommend making a reservation and coming at least once to try the bread. 

Parking: Easy.
